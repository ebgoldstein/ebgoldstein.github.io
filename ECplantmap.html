<h1>An interactive map of literature studies of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniola_paniculata">Uniola paniculata</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammophila_breviligulata">Ammophila breviligulata</a> along the US east coast</h1>
<p>The focus of this map is the region of range overlap for these two species (NJ-NC).</p>
<p>This map accompanies a paper that is currently in review.</p>
<li>Orange dots — locations of studies focusing on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammophila_breviligulata">Ammophila breviligulata</a>.</li>
<li>Blue dots — locations of studies focusing on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniola_paniculata">Uniola paniculata</a>. </li>
<li>Purple dots — locations where both are studied.</li>
<p>The map is interactive, you can zoom, pan, and click markers.</p>
